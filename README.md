In this work, we introduce the **I**terative step-level **P**rocess **R**efinement (IPR) framework, designed to enhance the training process of Large Language Model (LLM) agents through detailed step-by-step guidance. The IPR framework utilizes the Monte Carlo method to estimate step-level rewards and, during each iteration, allows the agent to explore and generate new actions along the expert trajectory. These actions are then evaluated against the corresponding step of the expert trajectory using step-level rewards to identify discrepancies, creating contrastive action pairs that serve as training data for the agent.

## üß© Structure of This Project
There are three main folders in this project: `envs`, `eval_agent`, `fastchat`, `textworld`

`envs`: the interaction environment of WebShop. We transform the original [WebShop](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/WebShop) repo into a package.

`eval_agent`: the evaluation framework of agent tasks, which is inspired by [MINT](https://github.com/xingyaoww/mint-bench).

`fastchat`: training scripts for SFT and DPO, which is a modified version of [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).

`textworld`: A text-based game generator and extensible sandbox learning environment for training and testing reinforcement learning (RL) agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

The setup script performs the following actions:

- Install Python dependencies for agent training, deployment, evaluation, and the environments for WebShop, InterCodeSQL, ALFWorld
- Download data and search engine indices for WebShop
- Download game files for ALFWorld
- Download data and create mysql environment for InterCodeSQL
- Download expert trajectories for supervised fine-tuning and mixture trajectory optimization

## üöÄ Quick Start

First, launch the controller of FastChat
```bash
python -m fastchat.serve.controller
```

The bash script `run_pipeline.sh` implements the IPR pipeline. For example, you can run:
```bash
bash run_pipeline.sh
```

The script performs the pipeline of IPR:

1. SFT phase: using the expert trajectories to conduct SFT to get the base agent
2. Evaluate SFT agent
   1. Launch the FastChat controller
   2. Launch the FastChat model worker
   3. Run the evaluation
   4. Kill the model worker. The controller will be reused in the following steps
3. Launch multiple FastChat model workers and let the base agent to explore the environment in parallel
4. Estimate step-level rewards
5. Build contrastive action pairs
6. Conduct mixture trajectory optimization to learn from incorrect actions
7. Evaluate IPR agent
8. Repeat 3-7 to iteratively update the policy

## üéÆ Evaluation

First, launch the controller of FastChat
```bash
python -m fastchat.serve.controller
```

Then, launch the model worker of FastChat
```bash
python -m fastchat.serve.model_worker --model-path <YOUR_MODEL_PATH> --port 21002 --worker-address http://localhost:21002
```

Finally, evaluate the agent
```bash
python -m eval_agent.main --agent_config fastchat --model_name <YOUR_MODEL_NAME> --exp_config <TASK_NAME> --split test --verbose
```

## üîÅ vLLM Integration

You can use vLLM as an optimized worker implementation in FastChat. It offers advanced continuous batching and a much higher (~10x) throughput. 

First, install vLLM.
```
pip install vllm==0.4.0.post1
```

However, the version of vLLM may conflict with the version of PyTorch and transformers. It is necessary to reinstall both the transformers and PyTorch libraries.

```
pip install transformers==4.37.2
pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```


The terminal would display a version conflict between vLLM, PyTorch, and transformers libraries. You can ignore this warning and proceed to run the `run_pipeline_vllm.sh` script.

```
bash run_pipeline_vllm.sh
```
